# Steganography in Digital Images

## Overview
This project demonstrates a method for securely hiding data within digital images using steganography. The provided code allows users to embed a secret message into an image and retrieve the message using a passcode.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`cv2`)
- OS library (`os`)

## Installation
1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

## Usage
1. Save your image file as `mypic.jpg` or replace the image path in the code.
2. Run the script to embed a secret message into the image:
   ```sh
   python steganography.py
   ```
3. Enter the secret message and a passcode when prompted.
4. The script will create an `encryptedImage.jpg` with the embedded message.
5. To retrieve the hidden message, run the script again and provide the correct passcode.

## Code Explanation
- The script reads the image and the secret message.
- It creates dictionaries to map characters to their ASCII values and vice versa.
- The message is embedded in the image by modifying the pixel values.
- The modified image is saved as `encryptedImage.jpg`.
- To decrypt, the script reads the encrypted image, checks the passcode, and retrieves the hidden message.

## Important Notes
- Ensure the image file path is correct in the script.
- Use a strong passcode to protect your secret message.
- The method embeds data in the image pixels, which may alter the image slightly but should remain imperceptible to the human eye.
